  <p></p><p></p><p></p> I am from Kirkland, Washington. I am currently a student at Juanita High School and expected to graduate in 2020. As of now, I am very interested in Business Communications and technology right now. I am multi-lingual, speaking fluently in English and Vietnamese, understanding Fukienese (Chinese Dialect), and am currently studying and going into my 4th year of Spanish. This summer, I signed up for the Girls Who Code's 2018 Summer Immersion Program that teaches me how to code. So far, I have enjoyed this program because I am able to meet new people and learn new things! I chose to take part of creating DVE because I was always interested in makeup and skincare for as long as I can remember. I also wanted to create DVE because I wanted to change the stigma that woman should be ashamed of wearing makeup and that makeup are only for females. When I was given the opportunity to work on the final project, I thought that it would be the perfect time to learn more about makeup and slowly make a change by making a website alongside Dellina and Vivi!

  <p></p><p></p><p></p> Hi, my name is Vierylis Jimenez I go by Vivi.  I am an incoming junior at Juanita High School, and will be involved in our Running Start Program this year. I was born and raised partly in Puerto Rico, but at 7 years old my family moved to Washington and I've been here since. I decided to participate in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program because of my strong interest in computer science and wanted to deepen my knowledge on coding. I have also had a passion with makeup and decided to make my final project about that. I was able to create a website with my peers Emily and Dellina. We created DVE with the purpose to change the beauty expectations in our society.  I love makeup because it's a way to express yourself while also looking good.

  <p></p><p></p><p></p> Hi, I am Dellina Gebrehiwot! I currently am a student at Lynnwood High School and participate in a program called Running Start, which allows me to take college course at Edmonds Community College. I am entering my senior year and graduate in 2019. I am interested in computer science and Girls Who Code drew my attention as we have had hands-on experience to a variety of languages and have worked on various projects to understand the process of coding. It has been an honor to work with a group of women who motivate me to continue coding and push me to do my best when coding. I also love how this program has allowed me to make new friends and learn something new everyday. As we were approaching our last 2 weeks we were given our final project assignment which we worked in small groups to complete a task. Our task was to create a website about makeup which we named DVE, which stands for our names; Dellina, Vivi, and Emily. I have always had an interest in makeup and how it allows individuals to be creative and expressive. But, several people see it was a beauty expectation and standard to look a certain way and DVE wants to break that expectation and express that everyone is beautiful in their own way.

  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  The three of us met this summer at the 2018 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, that teaches and encourages young girls to code and enter the future tech field. The program also hopes to raise the percentage of women in this field and end the gender gap. During this program we are taught to code, and each week we learned a new and different language such as Python, Arduino C, HTML, CSS, and Java. Throughout the last 2 weeks, we were given a challenge of making a final project where we would use all the new skills we have learned and applying them to make a website, game, app, and so much more.
  <p></p>
  Out of all the projects and topics we created a website about makeup. You might be asking yourself why makeup? And what will make it different from other makeup websites? Our mission was to create a unique web page to try to change stereotypes in the makeup and beauty community.  Living in a society where women are often being shamed for wearing too much makeup and often stereotyped into "trying to look good or impress the males", we are trying to change that mindset to allow individuals to express themselves. Makeup is not about impressing others, it is more about expressing who you are and it allows others to show their creativity. It is an art and should be appreciated. To carry out this goal, we decided to create DVE as a makeup website that not only has makeup and skincare products, but also a place where people of all colors and genders to upload an image of themselves on the website and draw "makeup" on the picture if they do not have access to the colors, shades, and specific types of products. We also have quotes throughout the web page to allow individuals to see daily reminds to boost their self-esteem and make them feel good.
