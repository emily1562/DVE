  <p></p><p></p><p></p> I am from Kirkland, Washington. I am currently a student at Juanita High School and expected to graduate in 2020. As of now, I am very interested in Business Communications and technology right now. I am part of the first generation Asian-American in my family with an ethnic background of Vietnamese and Chinese. I am multi-lingual, speaking fluently in English and Vietnamese, understanding Fukienese (Chinese Dialect), and am currently studying and going into my 4th year of Spanish. I love traveling, learning, and going out of my comfort zone and trying new things! I also love watching TV Shows, my favorite ones right now are Riverdale and Jane the Virgin! This summer, I signed up for the Girls Who Code's 2018 Summer Immersion Program that teaches me how to code and so far, it has introduced me lot to the world of technology and coding. So far, I have enjoyed this program because I am able to meet new people and learn new things! I chose to take part of creating DVE because I was always interested in makeup and skincare for as long as I can remember. I also wanted to create DVE because I wanted to change the stigma that woman should be ashamed of wearing makeup and that makeup are only for females. When I was given the opportunity to work on the final project, I thought that it would be the perfect time to learn more about makeup and slowly make a change by making a website alongside Dellina and Vivi!

  <p></p><p></p><p></p> Hi, my names is Vierylis Jimenez I go by Vivi. I love makeup because it's a way to express myself while also looking good. It is just something that I've always enjoyed since I was little. I am an incoming junior at Juanita Highschool. I was born and raised partly in Puerto Rico, but at 7 years old my family moved to Washington and I've been here since then. I've proudly spent this summer with Girls Who Code!

  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p></p><p></p><p></p> All 3 of us met each other this summer at the 2018 Girls WHo Code's 7 week long Summer Immersion Program that teaches and encourages young girls to code and enter the tech field in the future, hoping to raise the percentage of women in this field. During this program, we are taught to code, each week learning a new and different language such as Python, Arduino C, HTML, CSS, and Java. During the last 2 weeks, we are presented with the challenge of making a final project where we would use all the new skills we learn and apply them to make a website, game, app, and so many more.
  <p></p>
  Out of all the projects and topics we can create and make, why makeup? What will make it different from other makeup websites> What makes DVE different from other makeup websites is our mission to try to make a change in the community of makeup. Living in a society where women are often being shamed for wearing too much makeup and often sterotyped into "trying to look good or impress the males", we are trying to change that mindset. Makeup is not about impresisng others, it is more about expressing who we are as people and it allows others to show their creativity and who they are. It is an art and should be appreciated. To carry out this goal, we decided to create DVE as a makeup website that not only has makeup and skincare products, but also a place where people of all colors and genders to upload an image of thier on the website and draw the "makeup" on the picture if they do not have access to the colors, shades, and specific types of products.
